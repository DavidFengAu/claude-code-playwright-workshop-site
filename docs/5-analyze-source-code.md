# Workshop 5: Playwright Trace Viewer

## What is Playwright Trace Viewer?

**Trace Viewer** is like a "DVR for your tests" - it records everything that happens during test execution and lets you replay it later with full debugging capabilities. Think of it as having a time machine that lets you go back and examine any moment in your test.

## Next Steps

In the next exercise, you'll:
1. **Launch UI Mode** and explore the interface
2. **Run existing tests** and watch them execute
3. **Use step-through debugging** to understand test flow
4. **Generate traces** and learn to analyze them
5. **Debug a failing test** using the trace viewer

::: tip Remember
UI Mode and Trace Viewer are your best friends when developing and debugging tests. They transform testing from a "hope it works" activity into a "see exactly what's happening" experience!
